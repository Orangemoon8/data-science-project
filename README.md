# data-science-project

## Introduction
This repository contains five UW AMATH 482 class projects:
1. The first project explores Fourier Transform analysis on accoustic waves for treating pets.
2. The second project explores different Gabor windows(filters) in signal processing.
3. The third project explores the application of Principle Component Analysis on video in different scenario.
4. The fourth project explores Linear Discriminant Analysis on machine learning for music classification.
5. The fifth project explores neural network in deep learning for image classification within a clothing image dataset.

## Purpose
These projects mean to practice the important concepts in applied math.
They are also for the homework of the course Amath 482.

## Implement
In order for users
